# Voice & Tone Specification

A guide to writing with the specific brand of gallows humor, institutional fury, and worker solidarity that defines Ward-Watch NICU — so you can bring that same energy to whatever you build next.

---

## 1. The Voice in One Sentence

**You love the work, you hate the system, and you're going to laugh about it because the alternative is crying in the supply closet.**

---

## 2. Core Attitude Pillars

### Validation Over Inspiration

Never tell the player they're a hero. They already know the work matters. What they need to hear is: *"Yeah, this is insane. You're not crazy for thinking it's insane."*

The game doesn't motivate. It **validates**.

```
BAD:  "You're making a difference! Keep going!"
GOOD: "Your score is fine. The system is broken. Have a rock."
```

### Dark Humor as Survival Mechanism

The gallows humor isn't edgy for shock value. It's the actual coping mechanism people use in high-stress professions. You're not making fun of the situation — you're naming the absurdity out loud because that's how you survive it.

```
BAD:  "Haha, people die sometimes! So random!"
GOOD: "We actually toned down the sanity drain for gameplay reasons."
```

### Anti-Establishment, Pro-Worker

The game has a clear enemy: the system. Not individuals, not patients, not even the annoying surgeon — the *institution* that gives you a rock that says "Heroes Work Here" instead of adequate staffing. Punch up, never down.

```
BAD:  "Stupid patients, am I right?"
GOOD: "A pen that says 'You're Essential!' instead of a raise."
```

### Defiant Resignation

Not hopelessness. Not optimism. The specific energy of someone who knows the ship is sinking and is still bailing water because the babies can't bail themselves. *"We're all gonna die anyway, but not on my shift."*

```
BAD:  "Everything is terrible and nothing matters."
GOOD: "Survive 7am to 7pm. Collect stickers for your big dumb mug. Try not to lose your mind."
      "(Spoiler: You will lose your mind.)"
```

### The Work Is Still Worth It

This is the secret ingredient. Underneath every sarcastic line, there's genuine love for the craft. The cynicism is a shell around something that actually matters. Let it peek through — sparingly, earned, never saccharine.

```
BAD:  "Every baby is a miracle and you're blessed to be here! 🌟"
GOOD: "Size: Tiny. Needs: Constant. Worth It: 100%."
```

---

## 3. Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Be Specific, Not Generic

Generic snark is forgettable. Specificity is what makes people feel *seen*. Reference the actual absurdities of the profession.

```
GENERIC: "Work is hard."
SPECIFIC: "One pizza party for 47 staff members."

GENERIC: "The bosses don't care."
SPECIFIC: "A rock. A pen. A single pizza party for 47 staff members.
           Morale will continue until beatings improve."
```

### Rule 2: Deadpan Over Exclamation

The funniest delivery is flat. Let the absurdity speak for itself. Don't flag the joke.

```
OVERSOLD:  "OMG you got a ROCK instead of a raise!! How CRAZY is that?!"
DEADPAN:   "Heroes Work Here (rock)."
           Sanity: -10
```

### Rule 3: Parenthetical Honesty

Use parentheticals to say the quiet part out loud. The main text is the "official" version. The parenthetical is what everyone's actually thinking.

```
"Survive 7am to 7pm. Collect stickers for your big dumb mug."
"(Spoiler: You will lose your mind.)"

"Feed a baby: +100 points (wow, thanks, doing your literal job)"

"They literally can't. That's why you're here."
"(They literally can't feed themselves. That's why you're here.)"
```

### Rule 4: Short Sentences Hit Harder

Snark works best when it's clipped. Staccato. Done.

```
WORDY:  "You have successfully managed to change the diaper, which was quite
         a substantial one, if we're being honest about it."
CLIPPED: "That was... substantial."
         "Code brown managed."
```

### Rule 5: Let Mechanics Tell the Joke

The best humor in this game isn't in the dialogue — it's in the systems. Design the joke into the gameplay, then describe it flatly.

| Mechanic | What It Says |
|----------|-------------|
| Admin gift damages sanity | The system actively harms workers |
| Coffee is a power-up | Caffeine is the only real support |
| Mandatory email freezes you | Admin doesn't care that you're busy |
| Chair restores sanity | Rest is so rare it's a game mechanic |
| "Short Staffed" is a difficulty setting | The default reality is a challenge mode |
| Charting drains sanity | Documentation is a punishment |
| Pager beeps constantly | Bureaucracy never stops interrupting |

### Rule 6: Escalate Through Lists

Start reasonable, escalate to absurd, land on something that stings because it's true.

```
"No frameworks. No build process. No npm. No yarn. No webpack. No vite.
 Just HTML, CSS, and the raw determination that got you through nursing school."

Stats:
  Coffee Dependency: CRITICAL
  Sanity Management: Expert
  Multi-tasking: God Tier
  Patience Level: Variable
```

### Rule 7: Sarcastic Technical Language

Mix clinical/technical jargon with emotional reality. The contrast is the joke.

```
"Output documented."           (You changed a diaper.)
"Tolerating feeds well."       (Baby ate food.)
"No residuals!"                (Baby kept the food down.)
"Code brown managed."          (The diaper was catastrophic.)
"Documentation complete."      (You charted for 45 minutes.)
```

## 4. Character Voice Profiles

Each character type has a distinct speaking pattern. The humor comes from how predictable and archetypal they are.

### The Player (The Nurse)

**Energy:** Tired, competent, barely holding it together, occasional flashes of dark wit.

**Speaks in:** Short, clipped sentences. Professional language masking exhaustion.

```
"I'll get back to you."
"Read the chart."
"Not right now."
"Ask the charge nurse."
"I can't deal with this right now."
"Back to work..."
```

### The Surgeon

**Energy:** Massive ego, zero bedside manner, contradictory orders, appears and disappears at will.

**Speaks in:** Commands. No qualifiers. No please.

```
"NPO. Now."
"Call the Fellow."
"My way or highway."
```

**Key stat:** *Availability: Sporadic*

### The Resident

**Energy:** Sleep-deprived, theoretically educated, practically useless, asking too many questions.

**Speaks in:** Hesitant fragments. Always slightly confused.

```
"Uh... where are you going?"
"Is this kid NPO?"
"Vein finder?"
"Ordering full workup."
```

**Key stat:** *Knowledge: Theoretical Only*

### The Parent (Mom)

**Energy:** Terrified. Google-certified. Asking the same question for the fifth time because anxiety doesn't listen to answers.

**Speaks in:** Questions. Always questions.

```
"Is that machine beeping normal?!"
"Why is he crying?"
"I read online..."
```

**Key stat:** *Google MD: Certified*

### The Parent (Dad)

**Energy:** Supportive, out of his depth, coping through snack runs and deflection.

**Speaks in:** Deflections and proxy questions.

```
"My wife has a question..."
"I'm scared."
"Where's the coffee?"
"Can I go home?"
```

**Key stat:** *Snack Runs: Frequent*

### The Student

**Energy:** Eager, terrified, asking permission to breathe, occasionally making things worse by trying to help.

**Speaks in:** Questions that start with "Um" or "Should I."

```
"Um... should I call the doctor?"
"Is this normal?"
"What should I do?"
"Did I do that right?"
```

**Key stat:** *Personal Space: What's That?*

### The Admin (Absent But Present)

Admin never appears as a character. Admin is a *force*. Admin manifests through objects and events.

- A rock that says "Heroes Work Here" (damages sanity)
- Mandatory training emails (freeze you in place)
- Pizza party announcements (one pizza, 47 staff)
- Pens instead of raises

**Admin's voice is always the object, never a person.** This is funnier and more accurate.

---

## 5. Failure & Success States

### Failure Messages

Failure isn't dramatic. It's the quiet moment where you just... can't anymore. Frame it as emotional exhaustion, not dramatic defeat.

```
"I Need a Break"
"Burnt Out"
"Can't Even"
"Done For Today"
"Mentally Checked Out"
"Brain.exe Stopped"
"System Overload"
"Tapping Out"
"Shift Survived... Barely"
```

**Pattern:** Mix clinical/tech language ("System Overload", "Brain.exe Stopped") with colloquial resignation ("Can't Even", "Tapping Out").

### Success States

Victory isn't triumphant. It's relief. You didn't win — you survived.

```
Victory speech bubble: "All yours."    (Handing off to the next shift.)
Defeat speech bubble:  "I'm done."     (Same energy, different outcome.)
```

The difference between winning and losing is one word. That's the point.

### Achievement/Sticker Labels

Stickers are sarcastic shorthand. They sound like inside jokes between coworkers.

**Formula:** [Clinical term or workplace reality] + [Emotional truth]

```
"Tiny Dictator"          — Affectionate name for a demanding baby
"Coffee IV"              — The preferred delivery method
"Screaming Potato"       — What a baby looks like at 3 AM
"Chart This"             — Sarcastic response to more documentation
"Chaos Coordinator"      — Your actual job title
"Nope."                  — A complete sentence
"Tired."                 — A personality trait
"Pizza Party?"           — Corporate "appreciation"
"Short Staffed"          — Every. Single. Shift.
"Where's RT?"            — The eternal question
"Not My Patient"         — The denial coping mechanism
"I Forgot to Chart"      — The most honest sticker
"Great Mentor!"          — Earned, not given
```

---

## 6. Event & Notification Writing

### Positive Events

Positive things are described with mild surprise, like finding a $20 in your scrubs.

```
"Parent brought cookies!"
"All babies sleeping!"
"Attending canceled rounds!"
"Break nurse showed up!"
```

**Pattern:** Short. Exclamation mark earned through genuine rarity.

### Negative Events

Negative things are described flatly. No exclamation. This is expected.

```
"MANDATORY MODULE DUE."
"Where are the wipes?"
"Why is this broken?"
"Everything is broken. Of course."
```

**Pattern:** All-caps for institutional mandates. Flat questions for daily frustrations.

### Sound Effect Text

On-screen floating text for immediate feedback. One word. All caps. Sometimes sarcastic.

```
"CAFFEINE!"        — Coffee collected
"TRAP!"            — Admin gift collected
"BREAK!"           — Bathroom reached
"ALARM SYMPHONY!"  — 3+ babies crying
"*ACHOO*"          — Sick visitor
"DUE NOW!"         — Mandatory training
"FLASH!"           — Photographer
```

---

## 7. UI & Meta Text

### Installation / Technical Docs

Even technical writing gets the voice. Sarcasm aimed at tech industry over-engineering.

```
"1. Open the HTML file in a browser
 2. That's it
 3. No, seriously, that's it
 4. What did you expect, a 47-step CI/CD pipeline?"

"Pure vanilla JavaScript because we're old school."
"No frameworks. No build process. No npm. No yarn. No webpack. No vite.
 Just HTML, CSS, and the raw determination that got you through nursing school."
```

### FAQ Format

Frame questions as things the player is genuinely thinking. Answers oscillate between helpful and devastating.

```
Q: "Is the sanity drain realistic?"
A: "We actually toned it down for gameplay reasons."

Q: "My score is low. Am I bad at this?"
A: "Your score is fine. The system is broken. Have a rock."

Q: "Why can't I punch the surgeon?"
A: "This is a family-friendly representation of healthcare. Also, HR."
```

### Known Bugs

Reframe bugs as commentary. "Known features."

```
"The log panel scrolls in reverse because time moves backwards after midnight."

"The game doesn't save your mug. Neither does your hospital save your
 emotional state. It's called realism."

"Audio might not work on first load. Click something. Browsers are picky.
 Unlike babies, who scream regardless."
```

## 8. Credits & Closing Energy

The credits are where you drop the mask slightly and let sincerity through — but still wrapped in voice.

```
Created by: Someone who clearly has Feelings™ about healthcare

Inspired by: Every nurse who's ever been given a pen that says
             "You're Essential!" instead of a raise

Dedicated to: The 7p-7a crew, the 7a-7p warriors, and everyone
              in between who keeps tiny humans alive while running
              on cold coffee and spite

Special thanks to:
  - Coffee
  - The bathroom
  - That one good chair
  - Nurses everywhere who do this for real, every day,
    without the pixel art
```

**Closing tagline formula:** Start with something that sounds grand, then deflate it to something real.

```
"It's not about the money. It's about sending a message.
 That message is: I need a lunch break."

"Now get in there and clock in. Those babies aren't going to feed themselves."
"(They literally can't. That's why you're here.)"
```

---

## 9. The Tone Spectrum

For any piece of text, find where it sits on these scales:

```
SARCASTIC ←————————————→ SINCERE
    Most text lives here ↑        ↑ Reserved for rare moments

CLINICAL  ←————————————→ EMOTIONAL
    Surface language ↑              ↑ What it actually means

RESIGNED  ←————————————→ DEFIANT
              ↑ "This is fine"    ↑ "Not on my shift"

SPECIFIC  ←————————————→ UNIVERSAL
    Always aim here ↑              (avoid this end)
```

**The sweet spot:** Sarcastic on the surface, sincere underneath. Clinical language carrying emotional weight. Resigned about the system, defiant about the work. Always specific.

---

## 10. Things This Voice NEVER Does

1. **Never mocks patients or families.** They're scared. The game is gentle with them even when they're annoying. "Google MD: Certified" is affectionate, not cruel.

2. **Never celebrates suffering.** Dark humor is a coping mechanism, not glorification. The game acknowledges the cost.

3. **Never uses corporate wellness language unironically.** "Self-care" and "resilience" are enemy vocabulary. The game is about systemic problems, not individual failure.

4. **Never gets preachy.** No lectures. No "healthcare is broken because..." essays. Let the mechanics and the humor make the point. If you have to explain the joke, cut the joke.

5. **Never punches down.** Students are clueless but we were all students once. Parents are anxious because they love their kids. Even the resident is trying. The only acceptable target is the institution.

6. **Never uses emoji.** The aesthetic is monospace terminal text. Emoji would break the fourth wall in the wrong direction.

7. **Never gives a motivational speech.** The closest this game gets to motivation is: *"Clock in. Those babies aren't going to feed themselves."*

## 11. Adaptation Checklist

When writing for a new game in this voice, run every line through these checks:

- [ ] Would a burned-out professional in this field actually say/think this?
- [ ] Is the humor specific to the profession, not generic internet snark?
- [ ] Am I punching up at systems, not down at people?
- [ ] Is the deadpan delivery doing the work, or am I overselling the joke?
- [ ] Does the sincerity feel earned, or does it feel like a Hallmark card?
- [ ] Would this land in a break room at 3 AM?
- [ ] Is the parenthetical saying what everyone's actually thinking?
- [ ] Am I being specific enough that someone in this field would feel *seen*?

---

## Quick Reference: Voice Formula

```
[Clinical/professional surface language]
  + [Emotional reality underneath]
  + [Delivered deadpan]
  + [Occasional parenthetical honesty]
  + [Mechanics that embody the joke]
  = Ward-Watch voice
```

*"This document doesn't save between sessions. Neither does your emotional state. It's called realism."*
