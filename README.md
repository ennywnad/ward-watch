## What Fresh Hell Is This?

You're a NICU nurse. You have 6 isolettes full of tiny humans with opinions, a parade of people who've never changed a diaper asking you to explain ventilator settings, and exactly one (1) chair that may or may not be available when your feet finally give out.

Survive 7am to 7pm. Collect stickers for your big dumb mug. Try not to lose your mind.

*(Spoiler: You will lose your mind.)*

## Installation

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. That's it
3. No, seriously, that's it
4. What did you expect, a 47-step CI/CD pipeline?

**Works on:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, your phone, your tablet, probably your smart fridge

## How To Play

**WASD or Arrow Keys:** Move (oh wait, we didn't add that yet. Click to move like it's 1997.)

**Click/Tap:** Move your nurse around. She'll walk there. Eventually. When she's done with her current crisis.

**Mouse/Touch:** In mug mode, drag stickers onto your mug because this is what passes for "recognition" in healthcare.

### The Good Stuff (Things That Keep You Alive)

- ☕ **Coffee** - Temporarily makes you fast. You'll need 6 more in an hour.
- 🍕 **Pizza** - Cold. From the break room. Been there since Tuesday. Still better than nothing. +Sanity
- 🧻 **Bathroom Break** - The 30 seconds of peace you get while hiding in the staff bathroom. Maximum sanity restoration.
- 🪑 **The Chair** - Legend says if you sit down, you heal. Most nurses have forgotten what sitting feels like.

### The Bad Stuff (Your Shift In A Nutshell)

- 👨‍⚕️ **The Resident** - Fresh out of med school. Thinks a neonate is a type of rock. Will wake your baby to "assess." Drain your sanity by asking if the baby is "NPO" while literally holding the feeding tube.

- 😷 **The Surgeon** - Arrogant. Fast. Thinks nurses are just tall robots that dispense medications. Will give you orders in the hallway and expect you to have already done them yesterday. Maximum sanity drain. Avoid at all costs.

- 👪 **The Parents** - Terrified. Well-meaning. Read one article on WebMD. Will ask you 47 questions about why that machine is beeping. (It's always beeping. That's what machines do. Welcome to the NICU.)

- 🎁 **Admin "Wellness" Gifts** - A rock. A pen. A single pizza party for 47 staff members. Morale will continue until beatings improve. Actually *damages* your sanity because you know what would help? Adequate staffing.

### The Babies

Your 6 isolettes contain tiny potatoes who will need:
- 🍼 **Feeding** - Every 2-3 hours, just like real life, except these ones beep
- 💩 **Diaper Changes** - Output documentation is very important (and disgusting)
- 😭 **Calming** - Usually needed after a resident "helps"

Ignore them at your peril. They WILL let you know they're unhappy. So will your sanity bar.

## Scoring

- **Feed a baby:** +100 points (wow, thanks, doing your literal job)
- **Change a diaper:** +50 points (hazard pay not included)
- **Calm a screaming baby:** +20 points (and the satisfaction of silence)
- **Successfully dismiss someone annoying:** +200 points (priceless)

## The Mug Screen (AKA Your "Reward")

Survive the shift and you'll earn stickers based on your score. Drag them onto your emotional support Stanley cup.

Sticker options include:
- "NPO means NO" - For when someone asks you for the 8th time
- "Coffee IV" - Self-explanatory
- "Tiny Dictator" - What babies actually are
- "Chart This" - Your response to everything
- "Chaos Coordinator" - Your actual job title
- "Nope." - Your favorite complete sentence

Your mug spins. Because of course it does. You earned those stickers. Display them with the same energy you have at 6:58pm when someone asks if you can stay late.

## Tips For Survival

1. **Chase the coffee immediately.** You're not fast enough without it.
2. **The chair is a trap and a blessing.** Sit to heal, but you'll have to stand up eventually.
3. **Surgeons move FAST.** They're like the velociraptors of the hospital.
4. **Click people to handle them.** Walk up to that resident and give them the "read the chart" treatment.
5. **Bathroom breaks are SACRED.** That +40 sanity boost? Critical.
6. **Watch your sanity bar.** When it's red, you're one "Pizza Party Friday!" announcement away from a breakdown.

## Known "Features"

- Sometimes the mug rotation gets weird. Just like your sleep schedule.
- The log panel scrolls in reverse because time moves backwards after midnight.
- Audio might not work on first load. Click something. Browsers are picky. Unlike babies, who scream regardless.
- The game doesn't save your mug. Neither does your hospital save your emotional state. It's called *realism*.

## Technical Stuff (For The Nerds)

- Pure vanilla JavaScript because we're old school
- HTML5 Canvas with pixel art sprites
- Tailwind CSS via CDN because npm is for people with time
- Web Audio API for the beeps (all 6 of them)
- Touch support so you can play on your phone during your 30-second lunch break

**No frameworks. No build process. No npm. No yarn. No webpack. No vite.**

Just HTML, CSS, and the raw determination that got you through nursing school.

## Credits

**Special thanks to:**
- Coffee
- The bathroom
- That one good chair
